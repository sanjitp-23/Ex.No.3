# Ex.No.3 – Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques  

### REGISTER NUMBER: 212223230190

---

### **Aim:**  
To write prompts for the following prompt types and evaluate them using any one use case:  
1. Straightforward Prompts  
2. Tabular Format Prompting  
3. Preceding Question Prompting  
4. Missing Word Prompting  

---

### **Explanation:**  
**Use Case Chosen (from Unit 5):** *Cybersecurity – Phishing Attacks*  
Cybersecurity is a critical field that protects systems, networks, and data from cyber threats. One of the most common cyber threats is phishing, where attackers trick users into sharing sensitive information.  

We will apply all four prompt types to this use case.

### **Procedure & Example Prompts**

#### **1. Straightforward Prompts**  
Direct and simple queries to get specific answers.  

- **Prompt:** `Define phishing in one sentence.`  
  **Response:**  
  Phishing is a type of cyberattack where attackers impersonate trusted entities to trick users into revealing sensitive information.  

- **Prompt:** `List three ways to protect yourself from phishing attacks.`  
  **Response:**  
  1. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or email attachments.  
  2. Verify the sender's identity before sharing personal data.  
  3. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) on your accounts.  

---

#### **2. Tabular Format Prompting**  
Information is presented in a structured table format.  

- **Prompt:**  
  `Provide a table comparing phishing, malware, ransomware, and DDoS attacks with their definitions and impacts.`  

| **Attack Type** | **Definition** | **Impact** |
|-----------------|---------------|------------|
| **Phishing** | Trick users into revealing sensitive information via fake emails/websites. | Identity theft, financial loss, data breach. |
| **Malware** | Malicious software designed to damage or exploit devices. | Data corruption, unauthorized access, system failure. |
| **Ransomware** | Malware that locks/encrypts files and demands payment. | Data loss until ransom is paid, financial damage. |
| **DDoS** | Overloading a network/server with traffic to make it unavailable. | Service downtime, financial loss for businesses. |

---

#### **3. Preceding Question Prompting**  
A question followed by a deeper explanation or reasoning.  

- **Prompt:**  
  `Why are phishing attacks dangerous? Explain how they compromise user security.`  

**Response:**  
Phishing attacks are dangerous because they exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities. Attackers send convincing fake emails or messages that appear legitimate. When users click on links or enter credentials, attackers gain unauthorized access to sensitive data like bank accounts or business systems, leading to identity theft, financial loss, or data breaches.  

---

#### **4. Missing Word Prompting**  
Fill-in-the-blank style to encourage active recall.  

- **Prompt:**  
  `Phishing attacks often use fake ____ to trick users into sharing personal data.`  
  **Response:** **Emails**  

- **Prompt:**  
  `The best way to prevent phishing attacks is to enable ____ on accounts.`  
  **Response:** **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  

---

### **Conclusion:**  
Using the four prompt types, we explored how to generate diverse responses for the cybersecurity use case of phishing attacks. Each method provided a unique way to structure the query, improving clarity and depth of the generated responses.  

---

### **Result:**  
Thus, the prompts were executed successfully, and the report for the chosen use case was generated.
